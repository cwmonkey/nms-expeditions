title: Adding Static Expedition Config Files for Developers
tags: [news, refresh]
---

I have added a `patched` directory for developers etc to be able to reliably point to if they wish to use the latest "fixed" expedition configs in their projects. I don't require anything if you want to use these files, but credit is always appreciated.

You can access these files with Git or, you can link to them using the "raw" github links ([Example link for Expedition 1, Pioneers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cwmonkey/nms-expeditions/refs/heads/main/patched/01%20-%20Pioneers%20(Latest)/SEASON_DATA_CACHE.JSON){:target="_blank"}).

You can find all the patched expedition config files [in my GitHub project](https://github.com/cwmonkey/nms-expeditions/tree/main/patched){:target="_blank"}.
