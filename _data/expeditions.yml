          * Some player inventory tech modules and ship inventory tech modules are in the wrong spot. You will need to move them.

          * To find Atlas stations, ask Polo for Black Hole coordinates. That will show BOTH Atlas stations AND Black Hole systems on your galaxy map.

          * To leave the galaxy you need an Atlantid drive (and possibly to do the Atlantid quests), which is not possible. A patch has been created to replace the leave-galaxy milestone.

          * Freighters are very buggy in this expedition and they can be hard to acquire. A patch has been created to start you off with a freighter. This patch also rewards you with the first part of the pirate map as the P1M3 reward, since that can also be very buggy.

          * If you have an existing save in this expedition and need the pirate map fragment 1, use a save editor to give yourself the `PIRATE_MAPPROD0` item.

          * **Permadeath warning:** It is not possible to finish this expedition in permadeath mode. If you can avoid death until the final milestone, **your expedition AND primary save will be deleted** by "submitting."

          * The community milestones cannot be completed offline. A patch has been created to replace them with other milestones (ignore the message about Vile Spawns, you can collect them at any time). Unfortunately the Memory Fragments never upgrade.

          * This expedition breaks a lot, in particular the "reset save on death" mechanic. It seems to be working now, but if it breaks you can use the patch to disable it.
